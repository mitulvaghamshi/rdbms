## Designing a Database

- Step 1. Identify the Vital Entities
  - Interview representatives
  - Examine existing systems
- Step 2. Define Entities and Relationships
  - Determine the key and dependent attributes

## Step 1. Identify the Vital Entities

- Community Hospital DataBase (CHDB)
  - Patients
  - Doctors
  - Medications
  - Nursing units

## Step 2. Define Entities and Relationships

- CHDB patients
  - Name
  - Phone
  - Address
  - Health Card Number
  - Allergies
  - ??

- Cannot be directly implemented in DBMS
- Use intersection entities

- Patients and Physicians
- Patients and Medications
- Patients and Nursing Units
