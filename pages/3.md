# Indexes, Views & Sub-queries

## Need For Indexes

- If a SELECT statement is processed with no ORDER BY or WHERE clauses, all rows
  are returned in creation sequence -> Very fast
- If an ORDER BY clause is specified, the rows have to be sorted
- Any DBMS can sort 500 rows seemingly instantaneously
- Not so if there are 500,000 or 5,000,000 rows
- If a WHERE clause is specified, every row in the table would have to be
  checked to determine if the criteria was met
  - This is called a full table scan
  - Once again 500 rows almost instantaneous
  - 500,000 or 5,000,000 rows can take a long time
  - If need for data access is infrequent (i.e. once a month), maybe live with
    slow access
  - If access is regular (i.e. multiple times a day), creating an index will
    dramatically improve response time

## Index

- A separate structure pointing to the table data
- Multiple indices allowed on one table
- Consists of one or more columns
- Use is transparent once created
- Advantage:
  - Used to reduce access time
- Disadvantage:
  - Requires storage space
  - Requires work space
  - Needs occasional maintenance (rebuilding)
  - Slows down INSERT, DELETE and possibly UPDATE processing

## Binary Search Algorithm

- Only works with ordered (sorted) list
- Check the middle value, if that is the target, done
- If target is lower, eliminate all higher values
- If target is higher, eliminate all lower values
- Loop until done

## Index Clustering

- Physically sorts the data according to the clustered index
- Only 1 clustered index allowed per table
- Frequently, the primary key is clustered
- However, based on usage patterns it may make sense to cluster a different
  index

## Creating An Index

```sql
CREATE [UNIQUE] [CLUSTERED] INDEX  index_name
ON table_name
(column_name1 [ASC| DESC],
-- more columns
column_nameN [ASC| DESC])
```

- Example:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IX_patients_last_name
ON patients (last_name ASC)
```

## Primary Key

- Definition:
- A unique minimal identifier of an instance
- Used in
  - Index (created automatically)
  - Relationships

## Views

- What is a View?
  - A virtual table based on one or more tables
  - The View result set is not permanently stored in the database, but generated
    each time it is used
  - Shows up in INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS & INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
- Why do we use Views?
  - Provide a level of security
  - Provide a mechanism to customize appearance
  - Simplify frequently used complex SQL

## Table Patients contains 13 columns…

- How do limit access?
- What if a user only need to see 4 columns?

| Columns        |
| -------------- |
| patient_id     |
| first_name     |
| last_name      |
| gender         |
| birth_date     |
| street_address |
| city           |
| province_id    |
| postal_code    |
| health_card_no |
| allergies      |
| patient_height |
| patient_weight |

## Creating a View

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT …
```

- Cannot use ORDER BY
- Examples:

```sql
-- Ex: 1
CREATE VIEW ICU AS
SELECT patient_id, admission_date, discharge_date
FROM admissions
WHERE nursing_unit_id= 'ICU'

-- Ex: 2
CREATE VIEW current_admissions AS
SELECT nursing_unit_id, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM admissions
WHERE discharge_date IS NULL
GROUP BY nursing_unit_id
```

## Using a View

```sql
-- Ex: 1
SELECT *
FROM ICU

-- Ex: 2
SELECT *
FROM current_admissions
```

- Using a view is just like using a table

## Sub-queries

- Sometimes it is necessary to use data from one table to access data in another
  table
- A query within a query
- Must return only one column
- May return a single row or multiple rows, depending how it is used
- Can be nested

## Sub query Returns Single Row

```sql
SELECT *
FROM medications
WHERE medication_cost > (
    SELECT AVG(medication_cost) * 2
    FROM medications
)
ORDER BY medication_cost DESC
```

## Sub query Processing

- Sub query is processed first

```sql
(
    SELECT AVG(medication_cost) * 2
    FROM medications
)
```

- Sub query result set:

| (No column name) |
| ---------------- |
| 61.185838        |

- Main query is then processed using subquery result set

```sql
SELECT *
FROM medications
WHERE medication_cost >
(61.185838) -- Subquery result set
ORDER BY medication_cost DESC
```

## Sub query Returns Single Row

- Frequently used with an aggregate function (AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM) to
  ensure that only one row in the result is returned
- If more than one row in the result set is returned, query fails

## Sub query Returns Multiple Rows

```sql
SELECT nursing_unit_id, patient_id, admission_date
FROM admissions
WHERE nursing_unit_id IN (
    SELECT nursing_unit_id
    FROM nursing_units
    WHERE beds < 10
)
ORDER BY nursing_unit_id, patient_id
```

## Sub query Processing

- Sub query is processed first

```sql
(
    SELECT nursing_unit_id
    FROM nursing_units
    WHERE beds < 10
)
```

- Sub query result set:

| nursing_unit_id |
| --------------- |
| CCU             |
| ER              |
| ICU             |
| OR              |

- Main query is then processed using sub-query result set

```sql
SELECT nursing_unit_id, patient_id, admission_date
FROM admissions
WHERE nursing_unit_id IN
('CCU', 'ER', 'ICU', 'OR') -- Subquery result set
ORDER BY nursing_unit_id, patient_id
```

## Nested Sub query

```sql
SELECT nursing_unit_id, COUNT(*) AS patients
FROM admissions
WHERE nursing_unit_id IN ( -- Subquery processed 2nd
    SELECT nursing_unit_id
    FROM nursing_units
    WHERE beds > ( -- Nested subquery processed 1st
        SELECT AVG(beds)
        FROM nursing_units
    )
)
GROUP BY nursing_unit_id
```
