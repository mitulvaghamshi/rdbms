# Triggers

## What is it?

- A trigger is a special stored procedure attached to a specific table
- Supported by most RDBMS
- Managed by DBMS

## Triggers Versus Stored Procedures

| Triggers                                   | Stored Procedures                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Attached to a specific table               | Not attached to a specific table                 |
| Can’t pass values to a trigger             | Can pass values to a procedure                   |
| “Fired” automatically in response to event | Must be called by programs, triggers or manually |
| Event-driven                               | Not event-driven                                 |
| e.g. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE                | Can be scheduled                                 |

## Trigger Examples

- Reduce inventory when an item is sold
- Permit changes to employee records during business hours only
- Automatically ensure the salary is within range for the job when an employee
  receives a job change
- Audit trail / activity logging
  - Record changes to bank account
    - Withdrawal, deposit, modifying customer profile

## Why Use Triggers?

- Enforce business rules too complex for CHECK constraints or Referential
  Integrity
- Automate activity
- Access or modify other tables
- Downside: will slow down triggering operation (INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE)

## Scenario

- A part can be supplied by many suppliers
- A supplier can supply many parts
- Sounds like M:N
- Introduce a Quote table, where Quote represents the price quoted on one Part
  by one Supplier
- What does the ERD look like now?

## Use A Trigger To Enforce A Business Rule

- **Business rule #1**:
  - No more than three suppliers are permitted to supply any single part
- A trigger can check how many rows already exist for a specific part and
  prevent an INSERT
- **Business rule #2**:
  - The lowest cost supplier will always be used
- A trigger can disallow any order that does not use the lowest quote for a part

## Use A Trigger To Perform Calculations

- Use a trigger to calculate the order amount for the part based on the supplier
  chosen to provide the parts

## Trigger Syntax

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER Trigger_Name
ON  Table_Name
AFTER [INSERT] [,] [UPDATE] [,] [DELETE]
AS
    -- Optionally declare variables here
BEGIN
    -- Insert statements for trigger here
END
```

## Simple Trigger Example

```sql
USE db_name;
GO

CREATE TRIGGER employees_insert
ON employees
AFTER INSERT
AS
UPDATE company_stats
SET number_of_employees = number_of_employees + 1;

-- Test
PRINT '**********Before Insert**********'
SELECT * FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM company_stats;

PRINT '**********Insert**********'
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES(110, 'Bob', 'Loblaw');

PRINT '**********After Insert**********'
SELECT * FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM company_stats;
```

## Deleted And Inserted

- During trigger execution, two special tables are used: deleted and inserted
- SQL Server automatically creates and manages these tables
- They have identical schema to the table being modified

| Trigger Event | deleted    | inserted   |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| DELETE        | Old row(s) | Not used   |
| INSERT        | Not used   | New row(s) |
| UPDATE        | Old row(s) | New row(s) |

## Trigger 1

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER employees_update
ON employees
AFTER UPDATE -- Trigger will run AFTER modification occurs
AS
    DECLARE @new_salary MONEY;
    DECLARE @old_salary MONEY;
BEGIN
    SELECT @new_salary = (
        SELECT salary
        FROM inserted -- inserted used for values before the update
    );
    SELECT @old_salary = (
        SELECT salary
        FROM deleted -- deleted used for values after the update
    );
    IF @new_salary > (@old_salary * 1.5)
        ROLLBACK TRANSACTION; -- Cancel the UPDATE
END

-- Test
PRINT '**********Before Update**********'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 102;

PRINT '**********Attempted Update**********'
UPDATE employees SET salary = 1500 WHERE employee_id = 102;
GO

PRINT '**********After Attempted Update**********'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 102;

PRINT '**********Successful Update**********'
UPDATE employees SET salary = 850 WHERE employee_id = 102;
GO

PRINT '**********After Successful Update**********'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 102;

-- employees_update Trigger
-- If multiple rows are updated employees_update will fail
SELECT @new_salary = (
    SELECT salary
    FROM inserted
);

-- Test
PRINT '**********Before Update**********'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';

PRINT '**********Attempted Multiple Row Update**********'
UPDATE employees SET salary = 700 WHERE department = 'Sales';
GO

PRINT '**********After Update**********'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

## Trigger 2

```sql
ALTER TRIGGER employees_update
ON employees
AFTER UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT i.salary
        FROM inserted i
        JOIN deleted d
        ON i.employee_id = d.employee_id
        WHERE i.salary > (d.salary * 1.5)
    )
        ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
END

-- Test
PRINT '**********Before Update**********'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';

PRINT '**********Successful Multiple Row Update**********'
UPDATE employees SET salary = 600 WHERE department = 'Sales';
GO

PRINT '**********Attempted Single Row Update of 102**********'
UPDATE employees SET salary = 1500 WHERE employee_id = 102;
GO

PRINT '**********After Update**********'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

## Trigger 3

```sql
ALTER TRIGGER employees_update
ON employees
AFTER UPDATE
AS
    DECLARE employees_cursor CURSOR
    FOR SELECT i.salary, d.salary
        FROM inserted i
        JOIN deleted d
        ON i.employee_id = d.employee_id;
    DECLARE @new_salary MONEY;
    DECLARE @old_salary MONEY;
BEGIN
    OPEN employees_cursor;
    FETCH NEXT FROM employees_cursor
    INTO @new_salary, @old_salary;
    WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
    BEGIN
        IF @new_salary > @old_salary * 1.5
        BEGIN
            ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
            BREAK;
        END
    FETCH NEXT FROM employees_cursor
    INTO @new_salary, @old_salary;
    END
    CLOSE employees_cursor;
END

-- Test
PRINT '**********Before Update**********'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';

PRINT '**********Successful Multiple Row Update**********'
UPDATE employees SET salary = 750 WHERE department = 'Sales';
GO

PRINT '**********Attempted Single Row Update of 102**********'
UPDATE employees SET salary = 1500 WHERE employee_id = 102;
GO

PRINT '**********After Update**********'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

## Firing Triggers

- Timing choices
  - **AFTER**: after firing activity occurs
  - **INSTEAD OF**: allows DBA to take complete control of modification
  - Oracle, MySQL and DB2 also support **BEFORE** triggers
- AFTER example
  - **Insert**, **update** or **delete** occurs first
  - Trigger logic is executed
  - Trigger can **roll back** data modification

## Sample Trigger

```sql
-- PurchaseOrderLineInsert
USE CHDB;
GO
CREATE TRIGGER purchase_order_lines_insert
ON purchase_order_lines
AFTER INSERT
AS
UPDATE purchase_orders
SET total_amount = total_amount + (
    SELECT SUM(quantity * unit_cost)
    FROM inserted
    WHERE purchase_orders.purchase_order_id = inserted.purchase_order_id)
    WHERE purchase_orders.purchase_order_id IN (
        SELECT purchase_order_id
        FROM inserted
    );

-- Test
PRINT '**********Before Insert**********'
SELECT po.purchase_order_id, total_amount, SUM(quantity * unit_cost) AS Actual
FROM purchase_orders po
JOIN purchase_order_lines pol
ON po.purchase_order_id = pol.purchase_order_id
WHERE po.purchase_order_id = 50
GROUP BY po.purchase_order_id, total_amount;

PRINT '**********Insert**********'
INSERT INTO purchase_order_lines
VALUES(50, 2, 20, 10, 24.89, 0, 0, NULL);

PRINT '**********After Insert**********'
SELECT po.purchase_order_id, total_amount, SUM(quantity * unit_cost) AS Actual
FROM purchase_orders po
JOIN purchase_order_lines pol
ON po.purchase_order_id = pol.purchase_order_id
WHERE po.purchase_order_id = 50
GROUP BY po.purchase_order_id, total_amount;
```

## One Trigger Causes Need For Others

- If an INSERT trigger is keeping the master table updated when new records are
  inserted into a child table
- What happens on UPDATES or DELETES to the child table?
- Additional triggers are required to keep the tables in sync

## Sample Trigger

```sql
-- purchase_order_lines_update
CREATE TRIGGER purchase_order_lines_update
ON purchase_order_lines
AFTER UPDATE
AS
UPDATE purchase_orders
SET total_amount = total_amount + (
    SELECT SUM(quantity * unit_cost)
    FROM inserted
    WHERE purchase_orders.purchase_order_id = inserted.purchase_order_id) - (
        SELECT SUM(quantity * unit_cost)
        FROM deleted
        WHERE purchase_orders.purchase_order_id = deleted.purchase_order_id
    )
    WHERE purchase_orders.purchase_order_id IN (
        SELECT purchase_order_id
        FROM inserted
    );

-- Test
PRINT '**********Before Update**********'
SELECT po.purchase_order_id, total_amount, SUM(quantity * unit_cost) AS Actual
FROM purchase_orders po
JOIN purchase_order_lines pol
ON po.purchase_order_id = pol.purchase_order_id
WHERE po.purchase_order_id = 50
GROUP BY po.purchase_order_id, total_amount;

UPDATE purchase_order_lines
SET quantity = 1
WHERE purchase_order_id = 50 AND line_num = 2;

PRINT '**********After Update**********'
SELECT po.purchase_order_id, total_amount, SUM(quantity * unit_cost) AS Actual
FROM purchase_orders po
JOIN purchase_order_lines pol
ON po.purchase_order_id = pol.purchase_order_id
WHERE po.purchase_order_id = 50
GROUP BY po.purchase_order_id, total_amount;
```

## Sample Trigger

```sql
-- purchase_order_lines_delete
CREATE TRIGGER purchase_order_lines_delete
ON purchase_order_lines
AFTER DELETE
AS
UPDATE purchase_orders
SET total_amount = total_amount - (
    SELECT SUM(quantity * unit_cost)
    FROM deleted
    WHERE purchase_orders.purchase_order_id = deleted.purchase_order_id
)
WHERE purchase_orders.purchase_order_id IN (
    SELECT purchase_order_id
    FROM deleted
);

-- Test
PRINT '**********Before Delete**********'
SELECT po.purchase_order_id, total_amount, SUM(quantity * unit_cost) AS Actual
FROM purchase_orders po
JOIN purchase_order_lines pol
ON po.purchase_order_id = pol.purchase_order_id
WHERE po.purchase_order_id = 50
GROUP BY po.purchase_order_id, total_amount;

PRINT '**********Delete**********'
DELETE FROM purchase_order_lines
WHERE purchase_order_id = 50 AND line_num = 2

PRINT '**********After Delete**********'
SELECT po.purchase_order_id, total_amount, SUM(quantity * unit_cost)
AS Actual
FROM purchase_orders po
JOIN purchase_order_lines pol
ON po.purchase_order_id = pol.purchase_order_id
WHERE po.purchase_order_id = 50
GROUP BY po.purchase_order_id, total_amount;
```

## Deleting A Trigger

- To delete an existing trigger use:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER Trigger_Name
```

## Data Dictionary Tables For Triggers

- Every CREATE TRIGGER statement generates entries in
  - sys.triggers
  - sys.trigger_events
  - sys.events
  - sys.sql_modules
