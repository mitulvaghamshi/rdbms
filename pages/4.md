# Inserting, Deleting & Updating Rows

## CRUD

- All databases support CRUD
  - Create
  - Read
  - Update
  - Delete
- Thus far, we have focused on reading using SELECT
- All databases support CRUD
  - Create -> INSERT
  - Read -> SELECT
  - Update -> UPDATE
  - Delete -> DELETE

## INSERT Statement

- May insert a single row
- May insert many rows

## Inserting A Single Row

```sql
INSERT INTO tablename [(column1, column2, column3, column4)]
VALUES(value1, value2, value3, value4)
```

- Column names are optional
- If column names are not specified, all columns must have values

```sql
INSERT INTO tablename (column1, column3)
VALUES(value1, value3)
```

- If not specifying value for a column, other columns must be identified
- The missing column(s) must allow NULL or have a default value

## dental_services Table Schema

| Column              | Data Type | Length | Nullable |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| service_id          | Integer   |        | No       |
| service_description | Varchar   | 30     | Yes      |
| service_type        | Char      | 1      | Yes      |
| hourly_rate         | Money     |        | Yes      |
| sales_ytd           | Money     |        | Yes      |

## sales Table Schema

| Column           | Data Type | Length | Nullable |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| transaction_id   | Integer   |        | No       |
| transaction_date | Date      |        | Yes      |
| amount           | Money     |        | Yes      |
| service_id       | Integer   |        | Yes      |

## Inserting A Single Row

```sql
USE db_name
INSERT INTO dental_services (service_id, service_description, service_type, hourly_rate, sales_ytd)
VALUES(302, 'Temporary Filling', 'F', 100, 0)
```

- All column names and values provided

```sql
INSERT INTO dental_services
VALUES(101, 'Tricky Extraction', 'E', 200, 0)
```

- Column names not provided, so all columns must have a value specified

```sql
INSERT INTO dental_services
VALUES(202, NULL, 'C', 75, 0)
```

- Column names not provided, so all columns must have a value specified
- service_description column explicitly set to NULL

```sql
INSERT INTO dental_services (service_id, service_description, hourly_rate, sales_ytd)
VALUES(303, 'Filling', 85, 700)
```

- Column names provided
- ServiceType column omitted, will be set to NULL

## Table Creation with IDENTITY

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id   INT IDENTITY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(50),
    birth_date    DATE,
    salary        DECIMAL(8, 2),
    CONSTRAINT PK_employees PRIMARY KEY(employee_id),
    CONSTRAINT CK_salary CHECK(salary >= 0)
)
```

## Inserting A Single Row

```sql
INSERT INTO employees
VALUES('Bob', '2001-12-03', 750)
```

- Note that primary key value not provided
- Identity property will supply the primary key

## Inserting Multiple Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO tablename [(column1, column2, column3, column4)]
SELECT statement
```

- Same column rules apply as inserting single rows
- Column names are optional
- If column names are not specified, all columns must have values

## Create dental_service_archives

```sql
CREATE TABLE dental_service_archives (
    service_id          INT NOT NULL,
    service_description VARCHAR(30) NULL,
    service_type        CHAR(1) NULL,
    hourly_rate         MONEY NULL,
    sales_ytd           MONEY NULL
)
```

- dental_service_archives used for following examples has same schema as
  dental_services, but no constraints

## Inserting Multiple Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO dental_service_archives (service_id, service_description, service_type, hourly_rate, sales_ytd)
SELECT service_id, service_description, service_type, hourly_rate, sales_ytd
FROM dental_services
```

- All column names and values provided

```sql
INSERT INTO dental_service_archives (service_id, service_description, service_type, hourly_rate, sales_ytd)
SELECT *
FROM dental_services
```

- All column names and values provided

```sql
INSERT INTO dental_service_archives
SELECT *
FROM dental_services
```

- Column names not provided, so all columns must have a value specified

```sql
INSERT INTO dental_service_archives (service_id, service_description)
SELECT service_id, service_description
FROM dental_services
```

- Column names provided
- Omitted columns, will be set to NULL

```sql
INSERT INTO dental_service_archives (service_id, service_description, service_type, hourly_rate, sales_ytd)
SELECT *
FROM dental_services
WHERE sales_ytd >= 500
```

- All column names and values provided
- Only rows that meet criteria will be inserted

## DELETE Statement

- May delete a single row
- May delete many (all) rows
- WHERE clause is optional
- If not specified all rows will be deleted without warning

## Deleting A Single Row

```sql
DELETE FROM dental_services
WHERE service_id = 301
```

- WHERE clause uses primary key to locate one record
- This delete will fail due to referential integrity

```sql
DELETE FROM sales
WHERE transaction_id = 5
```

- WHERE clause uses primary key to locate one record
- This delete will succeed

## Deleting Multiple Rows

```sql
DELETE FROM sales
WHERE Amount >= 100
```

- WHERE clause locates many records

## Deleting All Rows

```sql
DELETE FROM sales
```

- No WHERE clause

## UPDATE Statement

- May update a single row
- May update many (all) rows
- WHERE clause is optional
  - If not specified all rows will be updated without warning

## Updating All Rows

```sql
UPDATE tablename
SET column1=value1, column2=value2
```

- No WHERE clause

## Updating A Single Row

```sql
USE CHDB
UPDATE departments
SET manager_first_name = 'Bob', manager_last_name = 'Loblaw'
WHERE department_id = 5
```

- WHERE clause uses primary key to locate one record
- New values hard coded

## Updating Multiple Rows

```sql
UPDATE items
SET item_cost = item_cost * 1.1
WHERE primary_vendor_id = 5
```

- WHERE clause locates many records
- New value provided by formula

## Updating A Single Row With A Sub query

```sql
UPDATE purchase_orders
SET total_amount = (
    SELECT SUM(quantity * unit_cost)
    FROM purchase_order_lines
    WHERE purchase_order_id = 10
)
WHERE purchase_order_id = 10
```

- Main WHERE clause locates one record
- Sub query WHERE clause locates many records
- New value provided by sub-query

## SQL Script

- Up to now, we’ve been executing one SQL statement at a time
- Frequently it is useful to execute many SQL statements at a time
- When many SQL statements are being executed, they must be terminated with a ;
- In this case, we create a SQL script
- Text file, typically with .sql extension
- When a “batch” of statements have been executed, the end of the batch can be
  signified by a GO statement
- The GO statement is usually optional, but can be required in certain
  circumstances
- Some CREATE statements require that they are the first statement in a batch
- There are a variety of SET commands that change the current session handling
  of specific information
- SET NOCOUNT ON
- Suppress INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE completion messages
- SET DATEFORMAT ymd
- Sets the date format to YYYY-MM-DD
- Many others
- Single line comments begin with

```sql
-- SQL single line comment
```

- Multi line comments are bounded with

```sql
/*
SQL multiline comment
*/
