# Predicates

## What is Predicates?

- A predicate specifies a condition that is true, false, or unknown about a
  given row or group
- Used in WHERE clauses
  - Basic Predicate
  - BETWEEN Predicate
  - EXISTS Predicate
  - IN Predicate
  - LIKE Predicate
  - NULL Predicate

## Basic Predicates

- A basic predicate compares two values
- =, <>, <, >, <=, >=

```sql
SELECT *
FROM admissions
WHERE nursing_unit_id = '2EAST'

SELECT first_name, last_name, patient_weight
FROM patients
WHERE patient_weight > (
    SELECT AVG(patient_weight)
    FROM patients
)
```

## BETWEEN Predicate

- The BETWEEN predicate compares a value inclusively with a range of values
- More compact version of >= AND <=

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, patient_height
FROM patients
WHERE patient_height BETWEEN 100 AND 125
-- WHERE patient_height >= 100 AND patient_height <= 125
```

## EXISTS Predicate

- The EXISTS predicate tests for the existence of certain rows using a subquery
- EXISTS returns true if a subquery contains any rows
- Find patients who take at least one medication

```sql
-- Patients Who Take Meds
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM patients
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM unit_dose_orders
    WHERE unit_dose_orders.patient_id = patients.patient_id
)
```

- Find vendors who don’t have any purchase orders
- All of the current vendors have purchase orders

```sql
-- Create a new vendor that doesn’t have any purchase orders
INSERT INTO vendors
VALUES(9, 'Medical Mart', '550 Matheson Blvd W', 'Mississauga', 'ON', 'L5R 4B8', 'McCoy', 'Leonard', 0)

-- Vendors Without Purchase Orders
SELECT *
FROM vendors
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM purchase_orders
    WHERE purchase_orders.vendor_id = vendors.vendor_id
)
```

## IN Predicate

- The IN predicate compares a value with a set of values
- For many cases, whenever the EXISTS predicate can be used, the IN predicate
  can be used

```sql
-- Patients Who Take Meds
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM patients
WHERE patient_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT patient_id
    FROM unit_dose_orders
)

-- Vendors Without Purchase Orders
SELECT *
FROM vendors
WHERE vendor_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT vendor_id
    FROM purchase_orders
)
```

## LIKE Predicate

- The LIKE predicate searches for strings that have a certain pattern

```sql
-- `%` matches any number of characters
SELECT first_name, last_name, primary_diagnosis
FROM patients
JOIN admissions
ON patients.patient_id = admissions.patient_id
WHERE primary_diagnosis LIKE '%Diab%'

-- `_` matches a single character
SELECT first_name, last_name, nursing_unit_id
FROM patients
JOIN admissions
ON patients.patient_id = admissions.patient_id
WHERE nursing_unit_id LIKE '_EAST'
```

## NULL Predicate

- The NULL predicate tests for null values
- Must be used with IS, not =

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, secondary_diagnoses
FROM patients
JOIN admissions
ON patients.patient_id = admissions.patient_id
WHERE secondary_diagnoses IS NULL
```

## TOP

- Not a predicate
- The TOP clause sets a maximum number of rows that can be retrieved

```sql
SELECT TOP 5 *
FROM patients
```

## TOP PERCENT

- Not a predicate
- The TOP with PERCENT clause sets a maximum number of rows that can be
  retrieved

```sql
SELECT TOP 5 PERCENT *
FROM patients
```

## HAVING

- Not a predicate
- A second WHERE clause
- Used with GROUP BY

```sql
SELECT nursing_unit_id, COUNT(*)
FROM admissions
GROUP BY nursing_unit_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 340
```
