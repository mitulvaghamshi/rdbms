# Introduction

## Tools

- [SQL Server 2017 Express Database](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=55994)
  - The actual database runs as a service
- [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15)
  - The application we will use to access the database
  - Both, freely available from Microsoft

## Windows Services

- SSMS is not the database itself, it is an application (with UI) that is used
  to interact with the database
- The database itself runs as a Windows service
- A Windows service is a long-running program that doesn’t require user
  intervention; it has no UI
- Databases (and other OS components) run as services
- Run Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), click More details if necessary, click
  Services tab to see all services

## What is a Database?

- A shared collection of logically related data, designed to meet the
  information needs of multiple users

## Database Terminology (_Smallest Component to Largest_)

- **Character**
  - Various alphanumeric characters, digital, and special characters
  - Examples: D b 4 7 * ;
- **Column**
  - Sometimes referred to as a field
  - The vertical columns of a database
  - Contains actual value consisting of one or more characters
  - Each column contains the same type of information for every record in table
  - Common columns relate data in multiple tables i.e. relation

- **Row**
  - Sometimes referred to as a record
  - The horizontal rows of a database
  - Each row contains one or more columns
  - Each row in table contains same columns

- **Table**
  - Collection of related rows
  - Tables can be linked together to view (or manipulate) data as if one table
- **Entity**
  - A person, place or thing
  - Represented by a table
- **Attribute**
  - A descriptor of an entity
  - Represented by column headings

- **Database**
  - Collection of related tables and other objects (views, triggers, procedures)

## Database Uses

- Retailing companies
  - Inventory data
- Manufacturing companies
  - Product data
- Banks
  - Account data
- Hospitals
  - Patient data
- Schools, Colleges and Universities
  - Student data

## What is a Data Dictionary?

- It is the repository of all data definitions for all objects within the scope
  of the database
- It contains meta-data (data about the data)
- Meta data examples:
  - Table name, column name, data constraints, primary and foreign keys, index

## Structured Query Language (SQL)

- History
- It started life as SEQUEL in 1974, an IBM product
- In 1980 it was renamed SQL
- There is a SQL standard maintained by the American National Standards
  Institute (ANSI)
- Most database vendors extend the standard
- It is the access language used by many Database Management System (DBMS)
  products, including Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, IBM DB2,
  Microsoft Access, SQLite and many more
- SQL is not a programming language
- Includes Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML)

## SQL Statements

- Data Definition Language (DDL)
  - CREATE table
  - CREATE index
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
  - SELECT
  - INSERT
  - UPDATE
  - DELETE

## SQL Characteristics

- SQL is not case sensitive
- Depending on the database vendor, data can be case sensitive
  - 'M' <> 'm'
- Character data must be inside single quotes

## Basic SELECT Statement

```sql
SELECT * (represents all columns)
FROM table_name
```

- Example:

```sql
select *
from patients
```

- SQL ignores white space
- Example:

```sql
select       *

               from

    patients
```

- Convention is to capitalize keywords and place each clause on its own line
- Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients

SELECT list_of_column_names, separated_by_comma
FROM table_name
```

Example:

```sql
SELECT patient_id, last_name
FROM patients
```

## SELECT Statement

- Keywords SELECT and FROM are required in most implementations, FROM is
  optional in SQL Server

```sql
SELECT nursing_unit_id
FROM admissions
```

## DISTINCT Clause

- Duplicates can be removed using DISTINCT qualifier

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT nursing_unit_id
FROM admissions
```

## Sorting Data

- Use ORDER BY
- Can be one or more columns in list
- Can be in ascending or descending order

```sql
SELECT list_of_column_names
FROM table_name
ORDER BY list_of_column_names
```

## ORDER BY Examples

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
ORDER BY last_name

SELECT *
FROM patients
ORDER BY city ASC, birth_date DESC
```

## Retrieving a Subset of Data

- **Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT list_of_column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE list_of_conditions
```

- **Example**:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM admissions
WHERE room = 5
```

- Use `WHERE`
- `WHERE` clause can hold multiple conditions using `AND` and `OR` logic
- Examples:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM admissions
WHERE room = 5 AND nursing_unit_id = 'CCU'

SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE province_id = 'NL' OR province_id = 'QC'
```

## Order of Clauses in SELECT

```sql
SELECT list_of_columns
FROM list_of_tables
WHERE list of conditions
ORDER BY expressions
```

## Expressions

- An expression can be
  - A column name
  - Text
    - 'this is a text string'
    - 10
    - last_name + ', ' + first_name
  - A function
    - LEN('Blake')
    - SQRT(144) + 5
    - STR(SQRT(99), 5, 3)
    - GETDATE()

## Conditions

- Purpose:
  - To specify a combination of one or more expressions and logical operators
    that evaluates to either TRUE, FALSE or unknown
- Comparison operators
  - =, !=, >, <, >=, <=, [NOT] IN, [NOT] BETWEEN x AND y, [NOT] LIKE, EXISTS, IS
    [NOT] NULL
- Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM departments
WHERE department_id IN (1, 5)

SELECT *
FROM departments
WHERE department_id NOT IN (1, 5)

SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE last_name LIKE 'cr%'

SELECT *
FROM admissions
WHERE room BETWEEN 2 AND 4
```

## LIKE Examples

- `_` matches a single character
- `%` matches any number of characters

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE last_name LIKE 'sm_th'

SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE last_name LIKE 'sm_th%'

SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE last_name LIKE '%sm_th%'

SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE last_name LIKE '%smith%'
```
